    <h2>Code of Conduct for OFCC</h2>
    <p>All participants in the COSA openFrameworks Contributors Conference (OFCC) are required to agree to the following Code of Conduct. This includes all attendees, speakers, performers, workshop leaders, patrons (sponsors), volunteers, and staff.</p>

	<p>The OFCC team is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, socioeconomic background, religion, or life experiences. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>

	<p><b>Be mindful of your language</b> — Engage with community members, mentors, and contributors with respect and good intention.</p>

	<p><b>Use your best judgement</b> — If it will possibly make others uncomfortable, do not say it.</p>

	<p><b>Be respectful</b> — While disagreements may arise, it is not an opportunity to attack or threaten someone else’s thoughts and/or opinions. Remember to approach every situation with patience, understanding, and great care.</p>
	<p><b>Be intentional</b> — Consider how your contribution will affect others in the community.</p>

	<p><b>Be open minded</b> — Embrace new people and new ideas. Participants with a range of technical skills were intentionally invited to this conference. This means we expect experienced participants to be patient with all earnest questions. Likewise, less experienced members should respect the experience and commitment of long-time community members. Take a moment to unpack the history of design decision and community habits together. The process may yield new insights.</p>

	<p><b>Definitions of Harassment include:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, religion, socioeconomic background, or life experiences</li>
		<li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment</li>
		<li>Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names</li>
		<li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images, comments/language, or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate</li>
		<li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop</li>
		<li>Unwelcome sexual or physical attention</li>
		<li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others</li>
		<li>Threats of violence</li>
		<li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm</li>
		<li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
		<li>Stalking or following</li>
		<li>Photography or recording that includes others without permission, including logging online activity for harassment purposes</li>
		<li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>
		<li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
		<li>Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect other OFCC community members or other vulnerable people from intentional abuse</li>
		<li>Publication of non-harassing private communication without consent by the involved parties</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p>OFCC prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. OFCC reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:
	<ul>
		<li>‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’</li>
		<li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”</li>
		<li>Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial</li>
		<li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p><b>Consequences, Reporting and Enforcement for the openFrameworks Contributors Conference</b></p>
	
	<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the OFCC team, who will be trained in how to address and report any incidents attendees bring to their attention. You may also contact us via email at <a href="mailto:COSA@du.edu?subject=Re%3A%20OFCC%20CoC">COSA@du.edu</a>.</p>
	<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from OFCC spaces (both on and offline), withdrawal of the stipend, identification of the participant as a harasser to other OFCC community members and/or the general public.</p>
